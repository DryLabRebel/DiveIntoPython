Dive Into Python Tutorial
=========================

Before I do anything else...

Is there a way send code from vim to a python shell?

How?

> As soon as you have a named argument, all arguments to the right of that need to be named arguments, too.

The sys.path is where python looks for libraries to import via module

    >>> sys.path
    [
    '', 
    '/Users/geoff/Documents', 
    '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python37.zip', 
    '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7', 
    '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload', 
    '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages'
    ]

colon + indentation = a function block
